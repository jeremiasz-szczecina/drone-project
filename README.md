# **Autonomous drone model steering (Bebop 2) using MATLAB + ROS/Gazebo architecture**
Project made during 6th semester (02.2021 - 06.2021) of my studies with my friend as a warm-up before working on an actual thesis.
**My contribution involved**:
* tuning drone PID controllers (ISE criterium) in a cascade structure for each axis (x, y, z, yaw angle), so when we wanted the drone to reach 3 meters - it *did* reach 3 meters with only a few milimiters precision
* implementing flight trajectory and option to gather and plot all the important data
* wrapping it up in simple GUI
* preparing final documentation
